# Abbreviations
BMR - Basal metabolic rate

TDEE - Total daily energy expenditure

BFP - Body fat percentage

# adaptive-tdee-tracker
Allows users to get an estimate of their total daily energy expenditure from their weight loss and calorie intake. Will be available on IOS and GP Store


# Advantages
Instead of calculating TDEE with body weight and estimations of calories burned, this application will give users their TDEE with 
two easily trackable and quatifiable values; their daily weight and the amount of calories they consume. Over time this application
will calculate the change in weight loss by week and based on the amount of calories consumed will provide an accurate TDEE customized
to the user.

# Disadvantages/Points of failure
Humans are notoriously inaccurate at eyeballing calories, so it is imperative that users use an app such as MyFitnessPal or another calorie
tracker in conjunction with a food scale in order to input accurate calorie data into the application.

The first week of weight loss is usually mostly water weight, which might skew the results. This requires users to be consistent with their
calorie and weight tracking over ideally a period of 6 weeks.

# Proposed features
User Accounts - Accounts will allow users to save their progress over multiple devices and allow data to be stored in the back end. Ideally 
will be able to integrate Apple id sign in for even easier log in and sign up.

Cloud storage - Will store data in a cloud server.

Simple UI - Simple UI for inputting the days weight and calorie intake.

Day viewer - Will be able to view and edit past data to correct errors or to check a specific days progress.

Graph - Graph that shows weight loss and calorie intake over time.
